        How the Emotion-Based Movie Recommendation System Works
      </h1>

      <div class="step">
        <h2 class="step-title">1. Fetching Popular Movies</h2>
        <p>
          We retrieve a list of popular movies using The Movie Database (TMDb)
          API. This gives us a wide range of movies that are currently popular
          with audiences.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <h2 class="step-title">2. Collecting User Reviews</h2>
        <p>
          For each movie, we gather user reviews and analyze the text for
          sentiment and emotional impact. These reviews provide insights into
          how viewers feel about each movie.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <h2 class="step-title">3. Sentiment and Emotion Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          We use two sentiment analysis tools, VADER and TextBlob, to analyze
          each review. Here’s what each tool provides:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>VADER:</strong> Measures the overall sentiment of each review,
          determining if it’s positive, neutral, or negative.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>TextBlob:</strong> Detects polarity (positivity or negativity)
          and subjectivity, which reflects how strongly an opinion is expressed.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <h2 class="step-title">4. Creating Emotional Profiles</h2>
        <p>
          Based on the analysis, each movie is given an
          <i>emotional profile</i> with scores that represent categories like
          "uplifting," "intense," "dark," "thought-provoking," "romantic," and
          "humorous." These profiles help us understand the dominant emotions
          associated with each movie.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <h2 class="step-title">5. Matching Your Preferences</h2>
        <p>
          When you select an emotional preference, the system recommends movies
          with matching profiles. For example, if you choose "uplifting," the
          system will prioritize movies with high positive sentiment scores.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <h2 class="step-title">6. Continuous Improvement</h2>
        <p>
          We continuously refine the emotional analysis based on feedback and
          improve the accuracy of the recommendations. This way, the system
          becomes better at predicting the emotional impact of each movie over
          time.
